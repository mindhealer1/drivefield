### ✅ What Was Done

- Initialized a Git repository for the DriveField Flutter project on my MacBook Air.
- Created a new public GitHub repository: [mindhealer1/drivefield](https://github.com/mindhealer1/drivefield)
- Generated a new SSH key using `ssh-keygen` with the ed25519 algorithm.
- Added the public key to my GitHub account.
- Verified authentication using `ssh -T git@github.com`.
- Set the remote origin to `git@github.com:mindhealer1/drivefield.git`.
- Pushed the code to the `main` branch with:
  
  ```
  git push -u origin main
  ```

### 🧠 Why This Matters

- Establishes version control and historical record-keeping.
- Enables easy sharing, collaboration, and backup.
- Prepares the project for future modular growth and remote team contribution.
- Confirms secure SSH-based authentication between this machine and GitHub.

### 📝 Notes
