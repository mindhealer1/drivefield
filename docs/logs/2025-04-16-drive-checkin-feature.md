# DriveField Project Log

## 🗓️ Date: 2025‑04‑16  
## ✨ Title: Heartbeat / Drive Check‑In – Skeleton Created & Git Sync Resolved
* * *

### ✅ What Was Completed
- **Repository clarity pass** – README & CONTRIBUTING updated in the GitHub web UI.  
- **Local scaffold** – created `lib/heartbeat`, `lib/models`, `lib/services` with empty Dart stubs.  
- **Git sync** – `git pull --rebase`, integrated remote edits, committed & pushed scaffold.  

*Commit hash:* `<initial‑scaffold‑commit>`

### 🌀 Symbolic Reflection
> “Clearing space in code felt like lighting the first candle for the ritual to come.”

*Drive sensed while working:* **Digital**

### 🛣️ What Comes Next
1. Add Hive dependencies (`pubspec.yaml`, `flutter pub get`).  
2. Implement `DriveEntry` model & generate adapter.

* * *

### 🔧 Folder & Syntax Cleanup (late evening)
- Flattened nested `docs/logs/docs` directory so all logs sit in `docs/logs/`.  
- Fixed typo `tends` → `extends` in `main.dart` & `navigator_core.dart`; IDE errors resolved.

*Commit hash:* `<cleanup‑commit>`

* * *

### 🌱 Hive Dependencies Added
- Added `hive` & `hive_flutter` to **dependencies**.  
- Added `build_runner` & `hive_generator` to **dev_dependencies**.  
- Ran `flutter pub get` successfully.

> *“I have installed the jars that will hold tomorrow’s memories.”*

*Commit hash:* `<hive‑deps‑commit>`

* * *

### 🧬 DriveEntry Model Created
- Implemented `lib/models/drive_entry.dart` with Hive annotations.  
- Generated `drive_entry.g.dart` via `build_runner`.  
- Committed & pushed the first data model.

> *“Tonight DriveField gained its first memory cell — a place to hold the breath of a day.”*

*Commit hash:* `<driveentry‑commit>`

* * *

### 🛣️ What Comes Next
1. Initialise Hive in `main.dart` (register adapter, open box).  
2. Create `DriveStorage` helper in `lib/services/`.  
3. Build the Drive Check‑In UI (`DriveCheckIn` widget).

* * *

### 🌓 Session Close – Drive Check-In UI Built and Aligned with User Intent

---

### ✅ What Was Completed

#### 🧱 UI Construction
- Implemented the `DriveCheckIn` widget as a `StatefulWidget` in `lib/heartbeat/drive_checkin.dart`.
- UI includes a dropdown to select a “Drive” (life focus), a multiline text field for an optional reflection, and a Save button.
- Connected Save logic to the `DriveStorage` service, writing `DriveEntry` instances to the Hive box.
- Routed `DriveCheckIn` as the app’s initial `home:` in `main.dart`.

#### 🌒 Dark Mode Theming
- Resolved the app’s bright white background issue by enabling dark mode:
  ```dart
  themeMode: ThemeMode.system,
  theme: ThemeData.light(useMaterial3: true),
  darkTheme: ThemeData.dark(useMaterial3: true),
  ```

#### 🧠 Terminology & UX Reframing
- Replaced abstract prompt *"Which drive is alive?"* with the more intuitive:
  - AppBar title: **"Focus Check-In"**
  - Label text: **"What are you working on today?"**
- Adjusted dropdown labels to use clearer, human-centered terms:
  - `'Driving & Movement' → 'Motion'`
  - `'Purpose & Motivation' → 'Motive'`
  - `'Digital Organization' → 'Digital'`

#### 🧰 Type Safety Fixes
- Converted `drives` list to a `List<Map<String, String>>` to distinguish human-facing labels and stored values.
- Resolved dropdown runtime error by explicitly typing the `drives` variable:
  ```dart
  final List<Map<String, String>> drives = [...]
  ```

#### 🛠 Error Recovery & Debugging
- Encountered and fixed:
  - Dropdown item mismatch crash
  - Type error due to `List<String>` vs `List<Map<String, String>>`

#### 🔄 Commit Flow
- All changes successfully staged, committed, and pushed to GitHub.
- Platform build files committed to maintain macOS/iOS sync.
- Removed the redundant `drive-checkin-feature-skeleton.md` log.

### 🌿 Symbolic Reflection

> “Darkness returned to the interface just as night fell around me.  
> The field no longer shouts — it listens. I don’t need to ask which drive is alive.  
> I only need to be honest about where I am.”

This check-in feature is no longer a prototype. It is **a daily ritual**, tuned by sight, speech, and intent.

---

### 🛣️ What Comes Next

1. **View Past Entries**
   - Create a History screen (`DriveEntryList`) to review previous check-ins.
   - Pull entries via `DriveStorage.all()` and display them in a `ListView`.

2. **Refactor Drive Definitions**
   - Create a shared drive model or config (`drive_definitions.dart`) to unify label/value usage across screens.

3. **Symbolic Integration**
   - Consider whether entries should trigger symbolic responses or visual cues.
   - Option to begin **DriveRhythm** tracking or cross-domain reflection logging.

4. **Future Syncing**
   - Evaluate syncing to Firestore for backup and timeline visualization.
   - Consider linking Drive.Motive or Drive.Digital to this daily record.

## 💤 End of Session Note

Michael closed the laptop around midnight, after completing a working check-in system that respects his energy, clarity, and rhythm. The DriveField project is now actively collecting living signals — structured in code, resonant in intention.
