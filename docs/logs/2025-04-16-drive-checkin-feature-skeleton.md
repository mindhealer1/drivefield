# DriveField Project Log

## 🗓️ Date: 2025‑04‑16
## ✨ Title: Heartbeat / Drive Check‑In – Skeleton Created & Git Sync Resolved
* * *

### ✅ What Was Completed
- Repository clarity pass (README & CONTRIBUTING).
- Local scaffold: `lib/heartbeat`, `lib/models`, `lib/services` with empty Dart files.
- Git pull ‑‑rebase to integrate remote edits; pushed synced history.

### 🌀 Symbolic Reflection
> “Clearing space in code felt like lighting the first candle for the ritual to come.”

*Drive sensed while working:* **Digital** (adjust if different).

### 🛣️ What Comes Next
1. **Add Hive dependencies** to `pubspec.yaml`, run `flutter pub get`.
2. Implement `DriveEntry` model & generate adapter.
