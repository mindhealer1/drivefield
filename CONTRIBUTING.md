# 🌱 Contributing to DriveField

DriveField is a living project built with clarity, intentionality, and symbolic alignment. Contributions are warmly welcomed, whether they're practical (code), symbolic (reflections), or structural (documentation).

This guide ensures our repository remains clear, aligned, and easy to navigate.

---

## 🌟 Philosophy of Contribution

DriveField is more than code—it's an evolving reflection of life alignment. Contributions should:

- Respect the project's **symbolic intent** and deeper values: coherence, clarity, safety, intimacy, and intentional action.
- Maintain **clear documentation**, thoughtful logs, and aligned project structure.
- Follow a steady, reflective rhythm—no rush, just thoughtful steps.

## 📝 Commit Style Guide

Clear, meaningful commit messages make the project's history valuable:

### Good commit messages:
- ✅ **"Add daily heartbeat widget for reflection prompts"**
- ✅ **"Update README.md with project continuity section"**
- ✅ **"Create log entry for model transition (GPT-4o → Navigator-o3)"**

### Avoid unclear messages:
- ❌ **"Update stuff"**
- ❌ **"Minor changes"**
- ❌ **"Fix things"**

**Format Suggestion:**  
Use simple, imperative language:
```
[Action] [Context]: [Brief Explanation]
```

For example:
- `Create Heartbeat widget: daily reflection entry`
- `Update CONTRIBUTING.md: clarify commit guidelines`

---

## 📂 Folder & File Structure

- Keep **Flutter code** in clearly structured directories:
```
/lib
  /core
  /ui
  /models
  /utils
  main.dart
```

- Place **markdown logs** documenting symbolic or technical milestones in:
```
/docs/logs/
```

- Regularly update core documentation (e.g., `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`) to stay coherent and accurate.

---

## 🔀 Branches & Pull Requests (if collaborating)

- Use short-lived feature branches clearly named for their intent:
```
feature/heartbeat-widget
docs/update-readme-continuity
fix/typo-contributing
```

- Open pull requests (PRs) with brief, thoughtful descriptions of why this contribution matters symbolically and practically.
