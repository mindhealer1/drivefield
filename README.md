# 🚗 DriveField

*A living Flutter app and symbolic framework aligning meaningful drives—mobility, digital organization, motivation, and family harmony.*

---

## 🌟 Overview

**DriveField** is more than an app—it's a system designed to unify and reflect the essential drives shaping Michael's life:

- **Mobility** (learning to drive, license acquisition, readiness)
- **Digital Organization** (Google Drive, device storage, backups)
- **Motivation & Purpose** (earning, creating, reflecting)
- **Family & Relationship Alignment** (connecting inner clarity with outer action)

DriveField is about aligning actions with deeper values: safety, service, intimacy, clarity, and coherence. It is built thoughtfully and intentionally—step by step, with clear documentation and symbolic reflection at every stage.

## 📱 The Flutter App

The DriveField app is built in Flutter, using Dart, structured with clarity and modularity in mind. Current status:

- **Initial Flutter project** (`main.dart`, `navigator_core.dart`) established
- **Version control and project management** via Git, GitHub, and SSH integration
- **Regularly updated logs** in `/docs/logs/`, tracking symbolic and technical milestones

Next stages involve creating intuitive visualizations, rituals, and interactive prompts—beginning with a lightweight daily "Heartbeat" ritual, evolving into more complex dashboards reflecting inner and outer drives.

## 🧭 Navigator

DriveField is guided by **Navigator**, a GPT-based AI agent that helps maintain alignment and clarity. Navigator ensures decisions reflect deeper intentions, offering step-by-step guidance on code, architecture, symbolic coherence, and meaningful development.

Navigator's voice is patient, clear, grounded, and insightful—ensuring each step remains aligned with the project's deeper purpose.
